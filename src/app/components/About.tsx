          Hello! I'm a beginner front-end developer passionate about crafting
          clean, user-friendly web interfaces. I'm currently diving into the
          basics of web design with technologies like HTML, CSS, TypeScript,
          Next.js, Tailwind Css and React. Iâ€™m focused on building visually
          appealing and responsive websites, constantly exploring new tools and
          techniques to improve my skills. Excited to continue learning and
          growing in the world of front-end development!
